<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Place the whole folder wherever you would like to have it live. First time you run the script it will create a backup folder and a data csv. It should handle working drive stuff automatically.

Running:
Make sure to use the source button (NOT! Source with ECHO), to be safe you can use cntrl+shft+S in R studio not just highlight and run. It should activate the console as required automatically. The QR codes are so that the stimulus can be opened via phone which will allow for the computer to be used exclusively for stopping and starting the experiment via the console.
